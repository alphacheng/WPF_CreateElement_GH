# WPF_CreateElement_GH
Demonstration showing MVVM design patterns, using data-bindings, INotifyPropertyChanged interface implementation, and use of Reflection.

This project is a condensed version of one of the tools on ExcelExpress.org. It's original implementation is for adding functionality to excel's UI to better hook into our backend. If you'd like to view the <i>full<i> functionality, you can visit my website <a href="https://www.excelexpress.org/section-analysis-plug-in-version-2-0-building-your-first-section/"><b>HERE</b></a>. The video at the bottom is a little long and dry...so sorry. 

Again, I've loaded this truncated version here, just for demonstration purposes on WPF.
